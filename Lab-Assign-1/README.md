## ‚ùì Problem 1
Develop a Python program that applies discounts to products based on their prices. The program should:
* Store product names and prices in a dictionary.
* Use a for loop with range() to process each product.
* Apply an **if-elif-else** statement to categorize discounts:
  * If the price is **above $500**, apply a **20% discount**.

  * If the price is **between $100 and $500**, apply a **10% discount**.

  * If the price is **below $100**, apply **no discount**.

## ‚ùì Problem 2
You are organizing a tech conference where attendees register for different sessions. Some attendees may register for multiple sessions, but you need to determine the total number of unique participants across all sessions.

>Write a Python program that:
* Takes a list of attendees for each session.
* Uses sets to find the unique attendees.
* Outputs the total number of unique participants.

>Use this test data in your program:
>>Session 1 attendees : Alice, Bob, Charlie

>>Session 2 attendees:  Charlie, David, Alice

>>Session 3 attendees:  Eve, Frank, Alice

>**Hint**:  You will use **union** to combine all sessions

## ‚ùì Problem 3
You are tracking the temperature readings of a city for 7 days. Given a list of recorded temperatures, write a Python program that:
* Uses a for loop with range() to iterate over the temperature readings.
* Computes the total and average temperature for the week.
* Displays both the total and average temperature.

Use this temperatures as your sample data: 30, 32, 29, 31, 28, 27, 33

**Note**: Use round() function to average temperature. Use 2 decimal places for the decimal point.
